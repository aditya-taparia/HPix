# Satellite Image to Vector Map Translation with HPix Architecture
In this project, I have build and train a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) called HPix that learns a mapping from input images to output images. This repository contains the implementaion, training and testing code for this network.

## Pretrained Weights
The pretrained weights for this model can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityataparia/hpix-weights).
